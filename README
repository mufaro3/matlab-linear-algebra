Selected MATLAB practice from "Exploring linear Algebra: Labs and Projects with MATLAB" by Crista Arangala

Note: all projects are designed to be run using GNU Octave, NOT MATLAB (not buying a license). To run file 'ch1_matrices/lab0.m', call

$ octave ch1_matrices/lab0.m

from the root directory. Additionally, all of the notes and solutions and whatnot are under a PDF file called the 'companion.'
